# Build-A-Site

I made this site as a parody of online website builders.

Funny enough, I made sure to use bolt.new during the 2025 vibe coding hackathon. After a few iterations of creative prompting this site was the result.

I was skeptical of vibe coding, but I'm glad I went all in. It was a fun experience. The low stakes of an impromptu personal project might have something to do with that. Nonetheless, my nature is to not be afraid to try new things. I'm glad I did.

Hope you enjoy.
